/CodeProjects is the most recently updated of the work that I've been completing. 

/CodeProjects/DomainDriven has the bulk of the work that I've done around developing good functional programming techniques.

The process I chose to model is reprocessing ore and ice products in Eve Online. To explain briefly, you can mine ore and ice in Eve, then refine that ore and ice into items that you can use in construction. I chose to model it with types because this process is so easy to conceptualize in OOP. I knew that I could use this project to connect the dots between functional programming style type modelling and object oriented modelling.  

For sanity's sake, I have the files named generally the same as the F# modules they contain. The two most interesting files are /CodeProjects/DomainDriven/Market/Market.fs and the console project that interacts with that code at /CodeProjects/YeFsharpConsole/dddmain.fs

I'm currently working on parallel code using OOP techniques to compare to the FP type driven techniques, and that will be located in /CodeProjects/ObjectOriented. Right now I have old OOP code that I developed and copy/pasted in there for storage, but that part of the project is far from well polished and well formed.
